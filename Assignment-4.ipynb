    "2.What are the different forms of data used in machine learning ? Give a specific example for each of them ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Most data can be categorical into 4 basic type of machine learning presperation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Numerical Data :\n",
    "Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers.Statisticians also might call numerical data,quantitative data.\n",
    "This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Categorical Data:\n",
    "Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown. Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Time Series Data:\n",
    "Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. It is very important, especially in particular fields like finance. Time series data has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Text:\n",
    "Text data is basically just words. A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it into numbers using some interesting functions like the bag of words formulation."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Numeric vs. categorical attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data are values obtained for quantitative variable, and carries a sense of magnitude related to the context of the variable (hence, they are always numbers or symbols carrying a numerical value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data are values obtained for a qualitative variable. categorical data numbers do not carry a sense of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data always belong to either ordinal, ratio, or interval type, whereas categorical data belong to nominal type. - - Methods used to analyse quantitative data are different from the methods used for categorical data, even if the principles are the same at least the application has significant differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data are analysed using statistical methods in descriptive statistics, regression, time series and many more.For categorical data usually descriptive methods and graphical methods are employed. Some non-parametric tests are also used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Feature selection vs dimensionality reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection you just select a subset of the original feature set, without any manipulation of the data on the other hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is typically choosing a new representation within which you can describe most but not all of the variance within your data, thereby retaining the relevant information, while reducing theamount of information necessary to represent it."

The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. So this visualization gives us the idea of bivariate relationship.\n",
